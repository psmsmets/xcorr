ccf

**ccf** is an open-source project containing tools to calculate
crosscorrelation functions. Results and meta data are stored as
xarray/netCDF4 following COARDS and CF standards.
`ccf` contains waveform preprocessing and crosscorrelation postprocessing
routines as well as a client wrapper to retrieve waveforms from local
and remote services.
