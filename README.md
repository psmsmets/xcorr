# CCF  - Cross-Correlation Functions -

**ccf** is an open-source project containing tools to calculate and store cross-correlation functions automatically with proper documentation. Results, parameters and meta data are stored as xarray dataset and stored to disk as a netCDF4 file, following COARDS and CF-1.7 standards.
